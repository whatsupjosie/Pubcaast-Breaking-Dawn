conftest.py — PubCast AI startup test fixtures
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
Provides two levels of test client:

  client_no_lifespan — raw app with no startup/shutdown, for import/route
                       structure tests that don't need services running.

  client             — full TestClient run through the real lifespan.
                       Every service will have initialised. Use this for
                       testing startup reliability and endpoint responses.

The lifespan client is session-scoped: the app boots once, all startup tests
run against it, and it shuts down cleanly at the end of the session.
