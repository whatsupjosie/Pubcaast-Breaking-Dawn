"""
test_02_routing.py — Route registration, ordering, and conflict detection
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
The most critical test in this file is the WebSocket route ordering check.

KNOWN BUG (fixed in main.py): /ws/{room} is a catch-all. If /unity/ws/{client_id}
and /studio/ws are registered AFTER it, Starlette matches them to the catch-all
first and the dedicated Unity/Studio handlers are never reached.

These tests enforce that the correct ordering is maintained permanently —
if someone reorders routes in main.py, a test will catch it before it ships.

Route-existence checks run against the fully-booted app (the `main_module`
fixture, which depends on `client` and therefore guarantees the lifespan has
run). Several routers — cameras, audio, mic, pubworld hotspots, lighting,
bridge — are mounted inside main.py's lifespan via `include_router()`, so
they simply don't exist yet on the bare pre-boot app object.

VERSION NOTE: the installed FastAPI (0.141.x) no longer flattens a included
APIRouter's routes into `app.routes` — `include_router()` appends a single
opaque `_IncludedRouter` wrapper instead, and dispatches through it lazily
at request time (`fastapi.routing._IncludedRouter.effective_route_contexts`).
Only routes decorated directly on `app` (e.g. `@app.get(...)`,
`@app.websocket(...)`) still appear as flat Route/WebSocketRoute objects.
Naively reading `route.path` off `app.routes` therefore misses every route
that arrived via `include_router()` — which is most of this app's surface —
even though those routes work perfectly at runtime. `_iter_effective_routes`
below recurses through `_IncludedRouter` wrappers to recover the real,
flattened route list; it falls back to the old flat behaviour on older
FastAPI versions that don't have `_IncludedRouter`.
